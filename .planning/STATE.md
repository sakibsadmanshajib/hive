## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Launch scope is the developer API, billing control plane, and developer console only.
- Hive must mirror the public OpenAI API surface except org and admin management endpoints.
- Prompt and response bodies must not be stored at rest for the API product.
- Launch monetization is prepaid Hive Credits only; subscriptions are deferred.
- Hosted Supabase is the v1 auth and primary relational data platform; no separate standalone Postgres server is planned initially.
- The developer workflow must run entirely inside Docker containers, including hot reload, builds, codegen, and tests.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Provider capability gaps must be handled explicitly so unsupported endpoints fail in an OpenAI-style way.
- Payment-tax behavior across Stripe, bKash, and SSLCommerz needs careful validation during Phase 8.
